                        Hi, my name is Ethan! I'm a junior in Comp Sci at Georgia Tech ðŸ˜Š My main interests are in UI/UX design, game development, and graphic design.

                        Away from the keyboard, I love being outdoors and remaining active. One activity I frequent is rockclimbing. I also play badminton, have a black belt in Taekwondo, and enjoy going scuba diving. I love photography especially when travelling. I take a deep interest in the many different styles in photography and often challenge myself to learn how to shoot in new styles.
